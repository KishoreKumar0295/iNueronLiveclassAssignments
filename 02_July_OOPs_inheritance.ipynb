    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a subclass can inherit from only one superclass. In other words, each class can have only one direct parent class. This creates a linear hierarchy, where classes are organized in a single chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance keeps the class hierarchy straightforward and easy to understand. There's no confusion about which superclass's attributes or methods are inherited, as there's only one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less Ambiguity: Since there's only one parent class, there's no ambiguity in case of conflicting method names or attributes from different parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a subclass can inherit from multiple superclasses, i.e., a class can have more than one direct parent class. This allows the subclass to combine features and behaviors from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse: Multiple inheritance enables more extensive code reuse, as a class can inherit functionalities from multiple superclasses. This can lead to more modular and efficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richer Class Functionality: By inheriting from multiple superclasses, a subclass can gain a diverse set of behaviors, making it more powerful and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Superclasses: The primary difference between single inheritance and multiple inheritance lies in the number of parent classes a subclass can have. Single inheritance allows only one parent class, while multiple inheritance allows more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy Structure: In single inheritance, classes are organized in a linear, one-dimensional hierarchy. In contrast, multiple inheritance creates a more complex, multi-dimensional hierarchy, as classes can have multiple ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity Resolution: In multiple inheritance, a challenge arises when two or more superclasses provide methods with the same name. The subclass must specify explicitly which version of the method it wants to use to avoid ambiguity. This issue doesn't occur in single inheritance since there's only one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing Between Single and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "The decision between single and multiple inheritance depends on the specific needs of the application. Single inheritance is generally simpler and less prone to ambiguity, making it easier to maintain. Multiple inheritance, on the other hand, offers greater code reuse and flexibility but requires careful handling of potential conflicts to avoid ambiguity. Some programming languages, like Java, support only single inheritance, while others, like C++, allow multiple inheritance, but developers must use it judiciously to maintain code clarity and prevent ambiguity.\n",

    "Significance of \"protected\" access modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: When a class member is marked as \"protected,\" it can be accessed by the class that defines it and any of its subclasses. This allows subclasses to inherit and use the protected members, promoting code reusability and extension.\n",

    "\n",
